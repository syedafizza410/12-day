/* Q34  Pizzas: Share your favorite pizzas and express your love for them.
Explain & TIP: Use a for loop to iterate over your pizza list, allowing you to express your preference 
for each type. This demonstrates looping through an array and appending custom messages to each item.*/


let pizzas: string[] = ["Chicken fajita", "margherita", "BBQ"];

pizzas.forEach(pizza => {
    console.log(`I like ${pizza} pizza.`);
});
console.log("I really love pizza!");


/* Q35 Animals: Highlight animals with a common trait.
Explain & TIP: Looping through an array of animals allows you to comment on each one 
individually. This teaches you how to personalize messages within a loop based on array items.*/


let animals: string[] = ["dog", "cat", "lion"];

animals.forEach(animal => {
    console.log(`A ${animal} would make a great pet.`);
});
console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet!");


/* Q36 T-Shirt: Create a function for customizing t-shirts.
Explain & TIP: Writing a function that accepts parameters allows you to reuse code efficiently. 
This introduces you to function parameters and printing dynamic content based on those parameters.*/


function make_shirt(size: string, message: string) {
    console.log(`Making a ${size} t-shirt with the message "${message}" printed on it.`);
}

make_shirt("medium", "Code with fizza");
